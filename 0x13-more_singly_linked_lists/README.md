What are Singly linked lists? Singly linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

A linked list is the most sought-after data structure when it comes to handling dynamic data elements. A linked list consists of a data element known as a node. And each node consists of two fields: one field has data, and in the second field, the node has an address that keeps a reference to the next node.

Linked lists can be of multiple types: singly, doubly, and circular linked list. In this article, we will focus on the singly linked list.

For constructing a singly linked list in C we make use of the structure keyword(struct), for creating user-defined data types, which can store various different types of data in the nodes of the singly linked list. The other is a pointer type variable, which stores the address of the next node.
