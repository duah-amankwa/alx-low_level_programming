This directory is on more singly linked lists in C programming

A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node

Linked lists can be of multiple types: singly, doubly, and circular linked list. In this article, we will focus on the singly linked list.

For constructing a singly linked list in C we make use of the structure keyword(struct), for creating user-defined data types, which can store various different types of data in the nodes of the singly linked list. The other is a pointer type variable, which stores the address of the next node.
