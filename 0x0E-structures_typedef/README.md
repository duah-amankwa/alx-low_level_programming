Structures
A structure is a user defined data type available
in C that allows to combine data items of
different kinds.

Structure declaration
● You can define a structure in the global
scope of your program (outside of all your
functions, just like the functions
prototypes).
● You can declare elements of your structure
in its scope.

The C programming language provides a
keyword called typedef, which you can use to
give a type, a new name.
typedef

After this type definition, the identifier ‘byte’
can be used as an abbreviation for the type
unsigned char, like in the example.
